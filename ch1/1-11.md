How would you test the word count program?
- You can feed a large number of different files in to the program but in a limited resource setting where you want realistic input, you could feed the source code of the program into its binary application.

Now, the problem that may arise is if we have a string in that program (or any input rather) that *resembles* \t, \\, or \b. For example, in the source code `'\n'` and `'\t'` would actually double counted as the contents of those strings are regarded as blank spaces, breaking the quotes into two words.
